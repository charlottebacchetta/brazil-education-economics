# ðŸ“Š Brazil ENEM Education Expenditure Analysis  

This repository contains the full **data engineering pipeline** for preparing Brazilian **ENEM exam data (2009â€“2022)** and linking it with **municipal education expenditure per student**.  

The scripts here demonstrate the process of **cleaning, aggregating, and merging raw datasets** into structured panel data suitable for econometric analysis (panel regressions, Difference-in-Differences, etc.).
